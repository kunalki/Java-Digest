      =============================================Abstraction==========================================================

Generalize or generic class can be abstract like vehicle animal human etc having some properties and  the class which will
inherit these classes will have these properties.So obviously generic class won't have objects on it's own but the class which
 will inherit these class can be instantiated on the reference of generic class.

Concrete Method = The method which has body is called concrete method. or we can say method with implementation.
Abstract Method = The Method which doesn't have body is called abstract method Or we can say Methods without implementation.

Abstract Method means methods without implementation can only be declared in Abstract class.
Abstract class can exists without having any abstract method. It is for them to have abstract methods necessarily.

We created abstract class and declared concrete methods and abstract methods both in it as per requirement.
Now all the child classes that are extending abstract class compulsorily will have to implement abstract methods in them
with its own definition. That is the benefit of abstraction. Here we just declared the abstract method, unnecessarily we
had not to implement the method in abstract parent class making the method abstract.

Abstract class can not be instantiated. Means Object of abstract class can not be created. We can certainly created the
reference of the Abstract class and object of the subclass which are inheriting the abstract class can be instantiate in the
reference of the abstract class.

Abstract class can have its constructor for any initial setup.

But Abstract classes should not have public constructors.
Constructors of abstract classes can only be called in constructors of their subclasses. So there is no point in making them
public. The protected modifier should be enough.

Protected access modifier is used when we want that field or method to be used in any of the classes which will extend the
class where these field has been declared.
